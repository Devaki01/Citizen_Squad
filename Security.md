## Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive guide to the security practices and data privacy policies for the Citizen Squad project. By adhering to these guidelines, developers and contributors can ensure secure storage, data privacy, and protection against vulnerabilities.

## 1. API Key Management
### Guidelines:
- **Avoid Hardcoding API Keys**: Never embed API keys or other sensitive credentials directly in the codebase.
- **Environment Variables**: Store API keys in environment variables and access them using your code.
    ```bash
    export API_KEY="your_secure_api_key"
    ```
- **.env File Usage**: Place sensitive keys in a `.env` file and ensure this file is added to `.gitignore`.
    Example `.env`:
    ```
    API_KEY=your_secure_api_key
    ```
    - **How to Use in Flutter**:
      ```dart
      import 'package:flutter_dotenv/flutter_dotenv.dart';

      String apiKey = dotenv.env['API_KEY'] ?? 'default_key';
      ```
- **Secret Management Tools**: Use secret managers like AWS Secrets Manager or Google Cloud Secret Manager in production.

### Risks of Exposure:
- Hardcoding keys can lead to **security breaches** if the repository becomes public.
- Monitor API usage for any unusual activity indicating key misuse.

## 2. User Data Privacy and Protection
### Data Storage Guidelines:
- **Encryption**: Use AES-256 encryption for data at rest. All personal data should also be encrypted during transmission using HTTPS.
- **Minimal Data Collection**: Collect only the necessary data required for app functionality. Avoid over-collecting user information.
- **Anonymous Data**: Use anonymization techniques where possible to reduce risk.
- **Regular Data Deletion**: Implement features that allow users to delete their personal data on request (in compliance with GDPR).

### Best Practices:
- **HTTPS Everywhere**: Ensure all data transmissions use TLS encryption.
- **Access Control**: Use role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive data.
- **Logging User Activity**: Track user activity securely for audit purposes, ensuring no PII is included in logs.

### Risks:
- Non-encrypted data can lead to **data breaches**.
- Improper handling of PII may result in **legal consequences** under regulations such as GDPR or CCPA.

## 3. Authentication and Authorization
### Guidelines:
- **Password Handling**:
  - Use strong hashing algorithms such as bcrypt for storing passwords.
  - Implement salt and pepper to further secure password storage.
- **OAuth2 or Firebase Authentication**:
  - Consider using third-party services for secure and scalable authentication.
  - Example: Firebase Authentication can provide email, Google, and phone login.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - Implement roles such as `admin`, `user`, and `guest` to ensure only authorized users access specific resources.

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
  - Encourage the use of MFA to add an extra layer of security.
  - Example: Use Google Authenticator or SMS-based OTP for critical operations.

### Risks:
- Weak passwords can lead to **brute-force attacks**.
- Lack of role-based control may expose **sensitive endpoints**.

## 4. Secure Development Practices
### Guidelines:
- **Static Code Analysis**: Integrate static analysis tools like SonarQube to detect vulnerabilities in real-time.
- **Dependency Scanning**:
  - Use tools like Dependabot to monitor outdated or vulnerable dependencies.
  - Regularly update packages to patch known vulnerabilities.

- **Secure Coding Guidelines**:
  - Sanitize user inputs to avoid SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
  - Avoid using eval-like functions that execute arbitrary code.

- **CI/CD Security Integration**:
  - Automate security tests as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
  - Example: Use GitHub Actions to run security checks on each pull request.

### Tools to Use:
- **Flutter Secure Storage**: For securely storing sensitive information on the device.
- **Linting Tools**: Enforce best coding practices.

## 5. Incident Response Plan
### Guidelines:
- **Monitoring and Alerting**:
  - Use logging frameworks to monitor app activities and detect anomalies.
  - Integrate alerts to notify administrators of suspicious activity.

- **Data Breach Protocol**:
  - Notify users immediately if their data is compromised.
  - Follow local laws regarding breach notification (e.g., GDPR mandates notification within 72 hours).

- **Backup and Recovery**:
  - Regularly back up critical data to ensure recovery in case of an attack.
  - Test backups periodically to ensure data integrity.

### Roles and Responsibilities:
- **Incident Response Team**: Assign specific roles for managing incidents (e.g., investigator, communicator).
- **Communication Plan**: Prepare templates for notifying users and stakeholders.

---

## 6. Logging and Monitoring
### Guidelines:
- **Sensitive Data Exclusion**: Ensure no PII or sensitive data is logged.
- **Log Rotation**: Implement log rotation policies to manage storage efficiently.
- **Audit Logs**: Keep track of all administrative actions for accountability.

### Tools:
- **Sentry**: Use for error tracking and monitoring.
- **Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK Stack)**: For advanced logging and visualization.

---

## 7. Security Testing Guidelines
### Types of Security Tests:
- **Penetration Testing**: Simulate attacks to find vulnerabilities.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Use automated tools to find security issues in the code.
- **Threat Modeling**: Identify potential threats and plan mitigation strategies.

### Automated Tools:
- **OWASP ZAP**: Automated vulnerability scanner.
- **Burp Suite**: For manual penetration testing.
